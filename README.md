# This is a Firefox extension, which adds the buff price percentage to items on dmarket.com.

I am currently working on the backend of this extension, so not all prices are available right now. I am also trying to bring the extension to Chrome soon.

Please always double check, before you do any trades, because I cannot guarantee that all price percentages are correct. There are often inaccurate results, if there is only 1 item listed on buff.
