# Firefox extension for dmarket.com

This Firefox extension adds the buff.163.com price percentage to CSGO items on dmarket.com, so you can make good trades using the site. The percentages are displayed in different colors based on their value. (Green means a good price for you if you want to buy the item and a bad price for you if you want to sell the item).

### Caution :exclamation:

I am currently working on the backend of this extension, so not all prices are available yet. I am also trying to bring the extension to Chrome soon.

Please always double check before making any trades because I can't guarantee that all price percentages are correct (Prices are updated every few hours). Also watch out, because there are often inaccurate results when only 1 item is listed on buff.
